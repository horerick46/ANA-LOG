# ANA-LOG
A software program called an Anomaly Predictor and Log Analyzer Tool is intended to spot odd trends, 
or anomalies, in system logs and forecast probable problems or system breakdowns.
Important attributes:

Log collection and parsing: 
Combines logs from several sources, including devices, servers, and apps.
Logs are parsed and arranged in organized forms for analytical purposes.

Anomaly detection: 
Finds odd patterns or outliers in the logs using statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, or preset criteria.
Unauthorized access attempts, unusual resource use, or abrupt increases in errors are a few examples of anomalies.
Using past data and present patterns, predictive analytics makes use of predictive modeling to predict probable system faults or performance deterioration.
notifies administrators before serious problems arise.

Visualization: 
Offers dashboards for viewing log data and abnormalities that have been found.
features timelines, heatmaps, and graphs to make it simple to see patterns and trends.

Analysis of Root Causes (RCA):
To assist in identifying the underlying causes of problems, correlate anomalies with particular occurrences or system modifications.

Alerts in Real Time:
Notifies users of abnormalities using email, SMS, or connected platforms (such as PagerDuty or Slack).
